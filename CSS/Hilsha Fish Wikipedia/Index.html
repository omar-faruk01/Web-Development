    <h1>Ilish, Hilsha Fish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The ilish (Tenualosa ilisha) (<a href="#nowhere">Bengali</a>: ইলিশ, romanized: iliš), also known as the ilisha,
        hilsa, hilsa herring or
        hilsa shad, is a species of fish related to the herring, in the family Clupeidae. It is a very popular and
        sought-after food fish in the Indian Subcontinent. The most famous hilsha fish comes from Chandpur District,
        Bangladesh. It is the national fish of Bangladesh[2] and the state fish of West Bengal.[3] The fish contributes
        about 12% of the total fish production and about 1.15% of GDP in Bangladesh. On 6 August 2017, Department of
        Patents, Designs and Trademarks under the Ministry of Industries of Bangladesh has declared the recognition of
        ilish as the product of Bangladesh. 70-75 percent of total produced ilish in the world is produced in Bangladesh
        which applied for Geographical Indication (GI) in 2004.[4] About 450,000 people are directly involved in the
        catching of the fish as a large part of their livelihood; around four to five million people are indirectly
        involved with the trade.[5] </p>
    <h2>Common names</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Other names include: jatka, ilish, ellis, palla fish, hilsha, ilih etc. (Assamese: ইলীহ/ইলীহি: ilih/ilihi,
        Bengali: ইলিশ: ilish, Gujarati: મોદાર/પાલ્વા: Modar or Palva, Odia: ଇଲିଶି: ilishi, Sindhī: پلو مڇي pallo machhi,
        Tamil: உள்ள மீன்/Ulla Meen, Telugu: పులస pulasa). The name ilish is also used in India's Assamese, Bengali and
        Odia community. In Iraq it is called sboor (صبور). In Malaysia and Indonesia, it is commonly known as terubok.
        Due to its distinguished features as being oily and tender, some Malays, especially in northern Johore, call it
        'terubok umno' (to distinguish it from the toli - which species is rich of tiny bones and not so oily). In
        Myanmar, it is called ငါးသလောက် in Burmese. </p>

    <h2>Description and habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The fish is marine; freshwater; brackish; pelagic-neritic; anadromous; depth range? - 200 m. Within a tropical
        range; 34°N - 5°N, 42°E - 97°E in marine and freshwater. It can grow up to 60 cm in length with weights of up to
        3 kg. It is found in rivers and estuaries in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Myanmar (also known as Burma) and the
        Persian Gulf area where it can be found in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in and around Iran and southern
        Iraq.[6] It has no dorsal spines but 18 – 21 dorsal soft rays and anal soft rays. The belly has 30 to 33 scutes.
        There is a distinct median notch in the upper jaw. Gill rakers fine and numerous, about 100 to 250 on the lower
        part of the arch and the fins are hyaline. The fish shows a dark blotch behind gill opening, followed by a
        series of small spots along the flank in juveniles. Color in life, silver shot with gold and purple. The species
        filter feeds on plankton and by grubbing muddy bottoms.[7] The fish schools in coastal waters and ascends up the
        rivers (anadromous) for around 50 – 100 km to spawn during the southwest monsoons (June to September) and also
        in January to April. April is the most fertile month for the breeding of ilish. The young fish returning to the
        sea are known in Bangladesh as jatka, which includes any ilish fish up to 9 inches long.</p>
    <h3>Food value</h3>
    <p>The fish is popular food amongst the people of South Asia and in the Middle East, but especially with Bengalis
        and Odias. Bengali fish curry is a popular dish made with mustard oil or seed. The Bengalis popularly call this
        dish Shorshe Ilish. It is also popular in India, especially in West Bengal, Odisha, Tripura, Assam, Gujarat and
        Andhra Pradesh. It is also exported globally. In Bengal and Odisha, ilish can be smoked, fried, steamed or baked
        in young plantain leaves, prepared with mustard seed paste, curd, eggplant, different condiments like jira
        (cumin) and so on. It is said that people can cook ilish in more than 50 ways. Ilish roe is also popular as a
        side dish. Ilish can be cooked in very little oil since the fish itself is very oily.</p>
    <h3>Possible extinction</h3>
    <p>ue to the demand and popularity of this species, overfishing is rampant. Fishes weighing around 2 to 3 kilograms
        have become rare, as even the smaller fish are caught using finer fishing nets.[19] As a consequence of this,
        prices of the fish have risen. In the past ilish were not harvested between Vijaya Dashami and Saraswati Puja
        due to some informal customs of Odia and Bengali Hindus as it is the breeding period of the fish. But as
        disposable incomes grew, wealthier consumers abandoned the old traditions.[20] The advent of finer fishing nets
        and advanced trawling techniques, and environmental degradation of the rivers, has worsened the situation.
        Fishermen have been ignoring calls to at least leave the juvenile "jatka" alone to repopulate the species. The
        fishing of the young jatka is now illegal in Bangladesh. This ban however has resulted in a rise in
        un-employment, as around 83,000 fishermen are unable to pursue their former livelihood for eight months every
        year. It has also led to the creation of a black market where jatka are sold for exorbitant prices.[21]
        Furthermore, the changes brought about by global warming have led to a gradual depletion of the ilish's breeding
        grounds, reducing populations of the fish even further.[22]</p>
