            <h2>History</h2>

            <h3>Early Settlement</h3>
            <p>
                Paleo-Indian people inhabited areas near Detroit as early as 11,000 years ago including the culture
                referred
                to
                as the Mound-builders.<sup>[16]</sup> In the 17th century, the region was inhabited by Huron, Odawa,
                Potawatomi
                and
                Iroquois peoples.
            </p>

            <h3>Later Settlement</h3>
            <p>
                The city was named by French colonists, referring to the Detroit River (French: le détroit du lac Érié,
                meaning
                the strait of Lake Erie), linking Lake Huron and Lake Erie; in the historical context, the strait
                included
                the
                St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River.

                In <time datetime="2008-09"> September 2008</time>, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick (who had served for six
                years) resigned following felony convictions.
                In 2013, Kilpatrick was convicted on 24 federal felony counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, and
                racketeering,<sup>[69]</sup> and was sentenced to 28 years in federal prison.<sup>[70]</sup> The former
                mayor's
                activities cost the city an estimated $20 million.
